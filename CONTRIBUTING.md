# Container Canary Contribution Rules

Contributions to Container Canary are very welcome!

## Developing

This project is written in Go and uses `make` for task running. Code should be formatted with `gofmt`.

### Building

You can build Canary into `./bin/canary` with:

```shell
$ make build
go build -o bin/canary .
```

### Testing

Tests require some example containers to use. Before you run the tests you must build them.

```console
$ make testprep
docker build -t container-canary/kubeflow:shouldpass -f internal/testdata/containers/kubeflow.Dockerfile .

...
 => => naming to docker.io/container-canary/kubeflow:shouldpass
 ```

You can then invoke tests with:

```shell
$ make test
go test -v ./...
...
PASS
```

## Linting

This project enforces linting with `golangci-lint`. You can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to check this automatically on commit, which will save time as you can catch linting errors before the CI does.

```console
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit

$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
